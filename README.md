# uk-phone-scam-numbers

This is a raw list of telephone numbers that are being used by scammers targeting users in the UK. A prettier list and more information on what you can do if you're being targeted by these can be found in the accompanying blog post over on my website at https://bret.dk/uk-telephone-scam-call-numbers

Comments are open on the above blog so feel free to leave any numbers you may have been targeted from there to keep them all in one place!
